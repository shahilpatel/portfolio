            <h3> <strong> State Quiz Game </strong> </h3>
            <h5> September 2019 - October 2019, Computer Science Principles </h5>
            <p class="card-text"> The goal of this project was to enhance a geography related game on MIT App Inventor, which could be played on a tablet. The original game was a guessing game of 10 States and Capitals in the United States.  My partner and I decided to improve the original game in different ways.  We made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQXmxtbqYwKwn79sOKRb4fZXIAWm1sP0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> to record everything that was accomplished in this project.  We added a timer, more states and capitals, a help page, a score table, and a celebrity quiz mode. We both worked together on the project and did not have a designated role. This was more efficient, as we were both on the same page for everything that was being done on this project.  We made sure to follow everything that was listed on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15p_dTKbxgZC407oPHWKzwtSm-PoCVkiz/view?usp=sharing" target= "_blank">rubric</a> to accomplish our goal.  A challenge that we encountered was the app not being able to support all 50 states. We decided to add more features to the app, and only have 15 states in our game.  We communicated well throughout the project, as most of the work on this project was done in class. If work was needed to be done at home, we communicated through text messages.  Some skills that I learned while doing this project, was that teamwork and communication can make or break a project. Communication allowed us to stay organized and work efficiently throughout the project.  I also learned that commenting on code can make finding mistakes and errors easier, which saves time and effort.

            <h3> <strong> Image Manipulation Project </strong> </h3>
            <h5> March 2020 - April 2020, Computer Science Principles </h5>
            <p class="card-text"> This project's goal was to edit and manipulate a collection of images to a clients demand. The client requested that our image would have a lasting impact on its customers by increasing brand loyalty and sales. I worked independently on this project. I made a daily <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zwRZydGGCqSaZhLzWywXu3po3IhHE0gI/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">log</a> to record everything that was accomplished in this project. For this project I added a logo, background images and images that would be pasted on the beackground. More information about the development and procedures of this project can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RX-Pp8qfhF704QjxQT68Vc3bIy1crMwp/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. I also made sure to follow everything that was listed on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aMJMXfJALOIXlUAn6paJnNyN8QoTCgTh/view?usp=sharing" target= "_blank">rubric</a> to accomplish my goal. A challenge that I encountered in this project was that adding text to the image using pillow was not feasible. Text would have to be from the downloaded font on the creator's local computer. I was using a Mac to complete this assignment,therefore if a user were to use Windows to view my images, the text would not appear. Due to this problem,I decided to add other edits to my images instead of text. From this project, I learned how to have proper time management skills and how it helps to accomplish a task more effectively and efficiently. I also learned about the vast capabilities that python has. It is able to edit images using Pillow in a professional manner.
